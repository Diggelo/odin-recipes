Odin recipe project

In this project i am going to make some recipies in HTML and link to a few recipes. I will use what i have learned so far.

- HTML (with body, head and html with meta and lang tags
- Lists UL and OL-tags
- Images img-tag
- Links A-tag
- Folders (directories) - MKDIR
- Paragraps - p-tag

Let´s see how this works out!
